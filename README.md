I think I haven't find the right way to open the Reset/Delete windows of a gizmo because I can't find way to remove it from the screen.
I also take a shortcut by adding a HandleButton on the sphere because I haven't succeed to use HandleUtility.nearestControl, that I believe is the right way.

# Precision

* CTRL+Z : Non implemente
* La fenetre Reset/Delete still show on the screen even if we click anywhere on the scene, so please click on the object everytime before you want to use one of the two buttons or an error would happended.
* La fenetre Reset/Delete don't activate with right click but lleft click
